Version description
--------------------------------------------------------
     
     This is a preliminary PCK containing draft values for the shape
     and rotation period obtained from [1] and placeholder values for
     pole direction (set to line up with the ecliptic north pole in
     J2000 coordinates.)

     This is a preliminary PCK containing valued for the shape, pole
     direction and rotation obtained from measurements described in [6].

Orientation constants for Asteroid 2867 Steins
-------------------------------------------------------- 
 
     The inertial reference frame for these constants is J2000; this is
     the default reference frame for PCK orientation data.
 
     The epoch of the constants is J2000; this is Julian ephemeris date
     (JED) 2451545.0.
 
     The NAIF integer code for 2867 Steins is 2002867. See the NAIF_IDs
     required reading for further information on NAIF integer codes.

     The pole direction was obtained from [11]:  "lambda = 94 deg +/- 5 deg,
     beta -85 deg +/- 5 deg, defined in Earth mean ecliptic frame".

     To calculate the coordinates in the J2000 reference frame, the following
     procedure was followed:

     - Calculate the XYZ coordintates of the pole, in the J2000 ecliptic frame.
     
     - Rotate the pole to the J2000 frame.

     - Calculate the right ascension and declination for the pole in the J2000
       frame.
       
     |-------
     
          SpiceDouble lambda = 94.0 * rpd_c();
          SpiceDouble beta = -85.0 * rpd_c();

          SpiceDouble pole_ecliptic[ 3 ];
          radrec_c( 1.0, lambda, beta, pole_ecliptic );
    
          SpiceDouble tx[ 3 ][ 3 ];
          pxform_c( "eclipj2000", "j2000", 0, tx );
    
          SpiceDouble pole[ 3 ];
          mxv_c( tx, pole_ecliptic, pole );
    
          SpiceDouble ra, dec, d;
          recrad_c( pole, &d, &ra, &dec );

          cout << "RA:  " << ra * dpr_c() << endl;
          cout << "DEC: " << dec * dpr_c() << endl;

     The calculated numbers are:
     
        RA:  90.7317
        DEC: -61.5709

        
     These numbers were slightly tuned, to adjust them to the 3D model of the comet.

     The W1 (prime meridian) term is taken directly from [11].
